- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with detailed logging for troubleshooting
- **Debug Information**: Provides debug information and logs for transparency
- **Download Options**: Download translated subtitles as .srt files
- **Multiple Encoding Support**: Handles various file encodings (UTF-8, CP1251, ISO-8859-5, UTF-16)

## Utilities

### SRT Normalization

The project includes a utility script (`normalize_srt.py`) for normalizing SRT files before translation:

```
python normalize_srt.py path/to/subtitles.srt -o path/to/output.srt
```

This helps ensure proper formatting and compatibility with the translator.

## Logging

The application includes comprehensive logging capabilities that can be enabled by setting `logging_enabled = True` in the `app.py` file. Logs are stored in the `logs` directory.
